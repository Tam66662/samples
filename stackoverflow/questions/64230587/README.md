Contents:
 1. SetWindowsHookExUiAutomationTest.zip: original submitted problem source code
 2. SetWindowsHookExUiAutomationTest-fixed.zip: A working fixed source code, based on question feedback. NOTE: If you compile the source as x64, it will only work when 64-bit app windows get focus (e.g. Chrome, Calculator, etc) not 32-bit apps (e.g. Outlook, Excel, etc.)
